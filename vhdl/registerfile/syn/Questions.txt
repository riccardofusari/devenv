QUESTION 1

In the first report, the shown path is from the output of the flip-flop 
to the output of the register file, without the clock. By adding the clock,
we can see that the path starts from one of the registers in the register
file and goes through the entire architecture until the output.

The report indicates that setting the clock to 2 ns places a constraint on
the time that is higher than the data arrival time of 0.40 ns from the synthesys tool. 
The parameter "clock network delay" refers to the time it takes for the clock signal 
to propagate from the clock source to the clock input of the flip-flop in the 
design. In our case, it is 0.00 ns, which means that an ideal clock signal 
is assumed to be used in the analysis.

Overall, the critical path is determined by the slowest elements of the circuit, 
which in this case are the combinational logic cells that make up the majority 
of the path delay. It is important to ensure that the critical path is optimized 
to meet timing requirements and avoid violations.

QUESTION 2

Even if the time constraint given by the clock should affect only the
combinational paths between two consecutive registers, we can see that
also the paths between the output registers and the output of the whole
architecture try to meet the constraint as reported also in the timing
report. This is probably due to the fact that our architecture is described
in a behavioral way, allowing the synthesis of the register file in a slightly 
different way from the one that we expected.
