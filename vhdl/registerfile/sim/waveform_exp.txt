At the start of the simulation, it can be observed that no read or write operations 
are performed. This is because the RESET signal is asserted high, and the enable signal 
is low. After the enable signal is asserted high and RESET is low, the first read 
operation is carried out on registers 22 and 28. However, since these registers have 
not been previously written, the output remains at zero.

At 6ns, the register 8 is written in the following rising edge of the clock (6.5ns),
as WR is set to '1'.

At 10ns, WR is set to '1', but since ENABLE is '0', no write operation is performed.

At 15ns, both the WRITE and READ1 signals are asserted high, with REG 24 being written 
and REG 8 being read. It can be observed that in the next clock cycle, both the output 
and register 24 are updated.

Another important behavior to highlight is at 35ns, where both the READ2 and WRITE 
signals are asserted high, with ADD_WR and ADD_RD2 set to 1E. In this case(as stated 
in the register file comment), the read operation will read the previous value stored 
in the register and forward it to the output, while the write operation is being 
performed. In the following clock cycle, the corresponding value will be available 
at the output2.
