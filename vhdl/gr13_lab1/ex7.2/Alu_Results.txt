As we expected, the ALU design is mostly combinational, with 379 of the 403 cells being combinational.
Infact the ALU performs primarly combinational logic operations. The buffer/inverter area is relatively 
small compared to the combinational area, which suggest that the design is not heavily reliant on buffering 
or inverting signals. The noncombinational area is also relatively small, indicating that the ALU design 
does not include a large amount of memory or other noncombinational components.

The timing report shows that the data arrival time for the most critical path (from the startpoint OUTALU_reg[15] 
to the endpoint OUTALU[15]) is 0.07, which means that the data will arrive at the output after a delay of 0.07 
units of time. The path is unconstrained, which means that there are no timing constraints specified for this path. 
The report also shows that the delay increment for the OUTALU_reg[15]/Q point was 0.07, which is the maximum delay 
along this path. The delay increment for the OUTALU_reg[15]/G point was 0.00, which means that there was no delay 
introduced at this point.
