RCA version 0 Questions:

1)
The problem was that both the carry IN and OUT were missing in the behavioral description, the solution we provided is the following:



variable carry: std_logic := '0'; --Initialize a carry variable to '0'
  begin
    -- Loop through each bit in the inputs A and B
  for i in 0 to NBITS-1 loop
  -- Calculate the sum of the three input bits and the carry bit
    S(i) <= (A(i) xor B(i) xor carry xor Ci) after DRCAS; -- Calculate the sum of the three input bits and the carry bit

   --Then, we calculate the new value of the carry bit.

    carry := ((A(i) and B(i)) or (A(i) and carry) or (B(i) and carry));
  end loop;

  -- Finally, we set the value of the output carry bit to the final value of the carry variable
  Co <= carry after DRCAC;
  carry := '0'; -- Reset the carry variable to '0'


2)
The differences among the three output signals are:
S1 is asociated to the output of the STRUCTURAL implementation without any delay in the carry generation.
S2 is ascociated to the output of the STRUCTURAL implementation with an assigned delay in the carry generation.
S3 is the output of the BEHAVIORAL description of the RCA.



3)
If we zoom to that time interval, we can observe that at 24.5ns the values of the signals are the following:
A = 0x15
B = 0x35
S1(STRUCTURAL): 0x0A
S2(STRUCTURAL): 0x0A
S3(BEHAVIORAL): Undifined since there is no carry management in the description provided

Looking at the outputs, we can observe that they are not showing the correct result, this is because there was an overflow since the addition cannot be represented in 6 bits.The carry out bit is correctly put to 1. The correct result of the addition will be 0x4A.
