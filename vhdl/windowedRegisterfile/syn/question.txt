            Question 3
########################################################

In the first synthesis, the register's most critical path was lower 
than the constraint, which means that the design met the timing requirements. 
However, with the windowed register file, the complexity of the design 
increased as expected, which also increased the most critical path. 
As a result, with a constraint on the clock of 2 ns, there is a negative slack, 
which means that the timing requirements are violated. In other words, 
the design is not meeting the timing requirements, and the clock period needs 
to be increased to allow for the slower path. This can be achieved by either 
optimizing the design to reduce the critical path delay or by increasing the 
clock period to meet the timing requirements. We chose to do the latter by
increasing the clock constaint to 2.5 ns.
