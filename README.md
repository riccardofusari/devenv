# Development Playground
Hey there! Welcome to my repo for practicing, where I keep all the code I write. Even though it's public, it's not really meant for outsiders to easily understand it. However, I'm glad you're here!

At the moment, here are the main topics I'm covering:

- SystemVerilog verification
- Scripting
- VHDL design
- C programming
